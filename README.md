1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Test your code thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. Use tools to check for security issues, and follow best practices for secure coding, like encrypting data and using secure communication methods.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Listen to what users want and need from the software. Focus on making it easy to use and solving their specific problems. Design the program to match those needs, ensuring itâ€™s both useful and user-friendly.

3. How do I approach designing software?
Start by understanding what the software needs to do. Plan the design with a focus on usability and security. Break down the project into smaller tasks, and use diagrams or models to visualize the design before you start coding.
